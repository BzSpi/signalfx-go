	// Tells SignalFx which external system it should use to send the notification. For an email notification, this is always \"Email\".
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// The destination address for an email notification. This address isn't validated, so you must ensure it's correct before you set it in a request. SignalFx may not save invalid values and may send a notification without an assigned email address.
